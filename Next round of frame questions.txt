When comparing the five frames, are we have multiple lists of islands as the parameters?
yes, must compare multiple islands.
Think something like this so we can pass a single array between them:
[frame1:[ island1:[(x,y) .. (x,y)] islandN:[(x,y) .. (x,y)] ] ..... frameN:[]]

How are we deciding if the island is the same? size color?
Followup: DO YOU MEAN BETWEEN FRAMES??
	issues with that would be depth and person's movements
	closer different color, arms tucked in, smaller size
	
	
Are we thinking about multi player?

Yes, need multi people support, won't be too bad as they'll be seperated into different layers for the ramdom forest, just tell which islands are humans (mini decicision tree)
